**Gina, Shona and Sumukh**

## <u>Project Proposal</u>

### Background

With restrictions that are commencing to ease in Victoria, there is great anticipation for many people to plan their vacations in regional areas of the state, especially during Christmas and New Years. Taking this into consideration, many families would like to quickly obtain information on their preferred destinations and determine the best accommodation, weather and population density to plan their vacation according to their needs. 

**Database Creation**

The purpose of this project is to obtain data from various different sources related to the following criteria:

1. List of councils in the State of Victoria along with the major city
2. Weather information utilising API calls to obtain historical data
3. Accommodation services using web scraping algorithms to obtain price, ratings and location
4. Tourist attractions 
5. Population density

**Project Rationale**

Upon creation of this Data Warehouse, users will be provided an opportunity to rapidly query their destinations and plan their vacations accordingly. The final database will be consolidated and uploaded onto a relational SQL database using the Postgres.
